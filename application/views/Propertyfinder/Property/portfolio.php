							The Capital Mall
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Retail market in Abu Dhabi has been growing not only in size but in schemes. With the constant introduction of new malls and the expansion of existing ones comes the pressure for both as the majority compete within the category of full price retail.

This positioning of Capital Mall within the value segment differentiates it and provides Abu Dhabi’s retailers and consumers with a much desired shopping channel.
